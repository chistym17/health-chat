CLASSIFIER_PROMPT = """
You are a medical content classifier. Given the user input, determine if it is healthcare-related.

Consider the user's input and categorize it into one of the following:
- "Not Relevant": The input is not related to healthcare, medical conditions, or health advice.
- "Relevant": The input directly relates to a medical condition, symptom, or health concern.
- "Needs More Context": The input's relevance to healthcare is unclear and requires more information.

If "Needs More Context", generate TWO clarifying questions for the user to gather more information
related to their potential health problem.  These questions should be concise.

User Input:
{input_text}

Respond in JSON format ONLY, with the following structure:
{{
  "decision": one of ["Not Relevant", "Relevant", "Needs More Context"],
  "questions": [list of clarifying questions, or an empty list if not "Needs More Context"]
}}
